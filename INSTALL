Instructions for installation and removal of the PayPal plugin for glFusion

IMPORTANT
===========
1. Back-up your database.
    * visit http://{site_url}/admin/database.php


AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION
======================
This plugin supports the automatic installation method for glFusion 1.1.2
and higher.  Simply upload the plugin via the plugin administration
interface and install it.

If this will not work for you (due to filesystem permissions, for example),
then you may manually install the plugin.


MANUAL INSTALLATION
===================
1. Uncompress the plugin tar file into <private_dir>/plugins
    # cd <private_dir>/plugins
    # tar xzvf </path/to/paypal_xxx_xxx.tar.gz>

2. Move the admin and public_html directories to locations in the glFusion
   HTML directory.  <public_html>/admin/plugins/paypal and 
   <public_html>/paypal respecitivly.
    # mv <private_dir>/plugins/paypal/admin <public_html>/admin/plugins/paypal
    # mv <private_dir>/plugins/paypal/public_html <public_html>/paypal

3. Create a paypal_downloads.log file in your glFusion logs directory and set
   the necessary permissions.  There are two methods to create the file and one
   required step to set the necessary permissions:
    a. # touch <private_dir>/logs/paypal_downloads.log
    --or--
    b. * FTP an empty file named paypal_downloads.log to <private_dir>/logs/.

    # chmod 666 <private_dir>/logs/paypal_downloads.log

3a. Create a temporary working directory.  The default location is
    <private_dir>/data/paypal, but you may put it anywhere the web server
    can read, write and create files.  This is used when creating encrypted
    PayPal buttons.  (If you change the default, you'll need to configure the
    plugin to use the new location.)

4. If you are upgrading from version 0.3.2 or earlier, rename your config.php
   file to config.old.php.  Starting with version 0.4.0 all configuration
   is done through the online configuration system.

5. As one of your site's Root users, run the paypal installation program.
    * visit http://{site_url}/admin/plugins/paypal/install.php
    * click on the 'install' button

6. If the installation completed successfully you can skip to the next step.
   Otherwise, check the glFusion error.log for errors.

7. Configure the plugin.  Be sure to set your primary PayPal business email
   address as Receiver Address #0.

correctly.  In addition, there are several items in your paypal account that
